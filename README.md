# aoc-lachrymating-leveret

Kotlin solutions to Advent of Code 2022 (also known as
the [year of the lachrymating leveret](https://twitter.com/terryandrob/status/1466043256391753733))

## Goals

As I'm not stretching myself with a new language this year, I've set myself some other challenges instead:

- ✔ Try to finish in the top 10 of
  the [Kotlin leaderboard](https://adventofcode.com/2022/leaderboard/private/view/236080)
    - ✔ I came **5th**! 🎉
- ✔ Try to make the top 100 globally just once, for any part of any problem
    - ✔ **85th** for [Day 8B](https://adventofcode.com/2022/leaderboard/day/8)
    - 🤏 **103rd** for Day 24A

And I'm also aiming ultimately for every solution to:

- ⌛ Not have anything hardcoded or specific to my input
    - ✘ 22B: Hardcoded the "wrap rules" for my specific net
- ✔ Be implemented as functionally as possible, with no mutation
- ✔ Run without any crazy memory/CPU requirements
- ⌛ Run in <500ms (each part)
    - ✘ 16B: ~5000ms
    - ✘ 20B: ~600ms
    - ✘ 23B: ~2500ms

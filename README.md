2022 Advent of Code solutions, in Kotlin.

## Goals

As I'm not stretching myself with a new language this year, I've set myself some other challenges instead:

- Try to finish in the top 10 of the [Kotlin leaderboard](https://adventofcode.com/2022/leaderboard/private/view/236080)
- Try to make the top 100 globally just once, for any part of any problem
    - âœ” *85th* for [Day 8](https://adventofcode.com/2022/leaderboard/day/8)
- Write every part as functionally as possible, with no mutation allowed
- Every part of every problem should run in <500ms

The latter two requirements can be sorted out later - for the first pass the code can be as hideous as necessary to
get the job done quickly!

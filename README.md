# aoc-lachrymating-leveret

2022 Advent of Code solutions, in Kotlin.

## Goals

As I'm not stretching myself with a new language this year, I've set myself some other challenges instead:

- Try to finish in the top 10 of the [Kotlin leaderboard](https://adventofcode.com/2022/leaderboard/private/view/236080)
- Try to make the top 100 globally just once, for any part of any problem
    - âœ” *85th* for [Day 8](https://adventofcode.com/2022/leaderboard/day/8)

And I'm also aiming ultimately for every solution to:

- Not have anything hardcoded or specific to my input
- Be implemented as functionally as possible
- Contain no mutation
- Run without any crazy memory/CPU requirements
- Run in <500ms (each part)

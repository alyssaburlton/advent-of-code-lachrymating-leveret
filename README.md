2022 Advent of Code solutions, in Kotlin.

## Goals

As I'm not stretching myself with a new language this year, I've set myself some other challenges instead:

- ⌛ Try to finish in the top 10 of
  the [Kotlin leaderboard](https://adventofcode.com/2022/leaderboard/private/view/236080)
- ✔ Try to make the top 100 globally just once, for any part of any problem
    - ✔ *85th* for [Day 8](https://adventofcode.com/2022/leaderboard/day/8)

And I'm also aiming ultimately for every solution to:

- ⌛ Not have anything hardcoded or specific to my input
    - ✘ 22B: Hardcoded the "wrap rules" for my specific net
- ⌛ Be implemented as functionally as possible, with no mutation
    - ✘ 19A & 19B
    - ✘ 22A & 22B
    - ✘ 23A & 23B
- ✔ Run without any crazy memory/CPU requirements
- ⌛ Run in <500ms (each part)
    - ✘ 16A: ~800ms
    - ✘ 16B: ~1200ms
    - ✘ 19A: ~3500ms
    - ✘ 19B: ~8500ms
    - ✘ 20B: ~600ms
    - ✘ 23A: ~1200ms
    - ✘ 23B: ~85000ms
